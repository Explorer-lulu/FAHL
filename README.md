# FAHL

This repo is the implementation of “FAHL: An Efficient Labeling Index for Flow-Aware Shortest Path Querying in Road Networks”

We have provided a full version of our revised manuscript in "FAHL_full_ICDE2025.pdf"

# How to use the index

We have provided a compiled FAHL for the query sample of the "roadsample"

Use these commands to start the querying:
cd into the folder and run 
./FAHL
